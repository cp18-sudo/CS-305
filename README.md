- Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report  

## Journal Reflection  

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that wanted to strengthen the security of its software systems. The main issue was identifying vulnerabilities in their code and making sure their applications followed secure development practices to protect sensitive client data.  

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**  
I did well in running a full vulnerability scan and then analyzing the results to highlight the most critical risks. Coding securely is important because insecure code can expose data, damage customer trust, and cost the company money. Strong software security helps protect both clients and the business while improving the company’s reputation and stability.  

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**  
The most challenging part was filtering through the scan results to separate real threats from false positives. That process was helpful though because it showed me how to prioritize issues and not waste time on things that don’t actually impact the system.  

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**  
I added layers of security by applying encryption, validating input, and following secure coding standards. In the future, I would continue to use tools like dependency checkers and static code analysis, along with regular penetration testing, to decide on the right mitigation steps.  

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**  
I made sure the code still ran as expected by testing its functionality after changes. To confirm it was still secure, I re-ran vulnerability scans and reviewed the updated code to check that no new issues were introduced during refactoring.  

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**  
I used dependency checkers, static code analysis, and encryption libraries. I also followed secure coding practices like input validation and avoiding hard-coded credentials. These habits will carry over to future projects.  

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**  
I could show them the vulnerability assessment report to demonstrate my ability to identify risks, document findings, and recommend improvements. I could also show the secure code updates to prove that I know how to apply best practices and keep software both functional and safe.
